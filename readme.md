<!-- Project: Loan Eligibility Prediction System
Overview:
Develop a Flask web application where users can input details such as income, age, loan amount, employment status, etc., and get a prediction of whether they are eligible for a loan using a decision tree algorithm.

Features:
User Input Form:

A web form to collect user data (e.g., age, income, credit score, employment type, loan amount, etc.).
Prediction Engine:

Use a decision tree model to predict eligibility based on input.
Model Training:

Train a decision tree classifier using a dataset (e.g., loan eligibility datasets from Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository).
Result Display:

Show the result (Eligible/Not Eligible) with a brief explanation of key decision factors.
Admin Dashboard (optional):

Upload a dataset and retrain the decision tree model dynamically.
Tech Stack:
Backend: Flask (for handling routes and API calls)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (for form design and result display)
Model: Scikit-learn (for decision tree implementation)
Database (optional): SQLite for storing user inputs or retrained models
Deployment: Heroku or AWS for hosting
Steps to Build:
Set up Flask App:

Create a Flask app with endpoints for the home page, form submission, and prediction.
Train Decision Tree Model:

Use Scikit-learn to build a decision tree classifier.
Train it on a loan eligibility dataset (preprocess the data as needed).
Integrate Model with Flask:

Save the trained model using joblib or pickle.
Load the model in Flask to make predictions based on user input.
Build Frontend:

Create an HTML form to collect user input.
Display prediction results on the same or a new page.
Testing:

Test the application locally with various inputs.
Deploy:

Use Heroku, AWS, or any platform to deploy the application for public use.
Example Flow:
User Input:
Enter details like age, income, employment status, etc.
Backend Processing:
Flask sends data to the decision tree model.
Prediction:
The model predicts whether the user is eligible for a loan.
Display Result:
Show "Eligible" or "Not Eligible" along with key decision factors. -->
